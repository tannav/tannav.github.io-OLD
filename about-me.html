		                            <p>My name is Vivek Tanna, I'm a graphic designer living in Portland, OR. I'm an Oregon State alum who has a degree in Graphic Design with a minor in Business and Entrepreneurship. (Go Beavs!)<br><br>My design philosophy is centered around the role that data can play in the design process and how good design is heavily impacted by the data available to us. As we continue to enter the age of big data, I believe that there will be more and more opportunities for creative to be impacted by exploratory data, putting us in an opportunity as creatives to listen to the data and the stories it contains, and then allowing the learnings from the data to be evident in our output. <br><br>To me, this heavily impacts my interest and belief in UX. A mentor once told me "The best UX is the one that does what the end user wants, without them knowing that it's there." The best, most efficient way from my perspective to do this is to look at the data for that particular site and see what the users need. Although it's possible to draw trends and come up with best practices for different experiences, humans are inconsistent by nature, and we interact with different brands in different ways – making it critical to see how they interact with the site in question in order to provide them with the best experience.</p>

		                            <p>When I'm not working, you can usually find me out in nature on some sort of adventure, whether that be hiking, biking, kayaking, or sitting in my hammock with a good book. Having spent my formative years on the East Coast before my family moved to Southern California when I was 8, I have a deep appreciation for nature and our ability to go out and have a broad array of environments at our feet, whether that be an ocean, a mountain or a waterfall.&nbsp;<br><br>Along with my passion for nature, I'm also incredibly passionate about sports – specifically soccer and basketball, but at the same time, I'm always willing to watch any other sports. As a designer, I'm intrigued by the intersection of sports and design; to me, professional sports bring people of diverse backgrounds and different situations together, and I see design having the capability to do that as well. This is a theme that's evident in a lot of my work, and it's something I want to continue pursuing.</p>
